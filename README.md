# My Redis Server

A lightweight Redis-compatible server implementation in Node.js.

## Features

-   Basic Redis commands (SET, GET, DELETE, EXISTS, PING, FLUSHALL)
-   Key expiration support
-   Persistence through snapshots
-   RESP protocol implementation

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
node server/index.js
```

The server will start on port 4000 by default.

## Supported Commands

-   SET key value
-   GET key
-   DELETE key
-   EXISTS key
-   PING
-   FLUSHALL
-   EXPIRE key seconds

Suggested Features

1. Data Structures:

    - Support for different data structures (e.g., strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes).
    - Implement commands for each data structure, similar to Redis.

2. Persistence:

    - Implement snapshotting or journaling to persist data periodically to disk.
    - Allow loading data from a file on startup.

3. Pub/Sub:

    - Implement a publish/subscribe mechanism for real-time updates.

4. Transactions:

    - Support for transactions to execute multiple commands atomically.

5. Expiration:

    - Implement TTL (time-to-live) for keys to automatically delete them after a certain time.

6. Replication:

    - Implement a master-slave replication model for data redundancy.

7. Clustering:

    - Support sharding and clustering to distribute data across multiple instances.

8. Monitoring:
    - Implement monitoring tools to track performance metrics (e.g., memory usage, command execution time).

Optimizations

1. Data Storage:

    - Use efficient data structures such as Maps or Sets for fast access.
    - Consider implementing custom data structures for specific use cases.

2. Serialization:

    - Use efficient serialization methods (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers) for storing complex data types.

3. Memory Management:

    - Monitor memory usage and implement eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU) to manage memory effectively.

4. Concurrency:

    - Implement locks or use atomic operations to handle concurrent access safely.

5. Caching:
    - Use in-memory caching for frequently accessed data to reduce latency.

Conclusion

This foundation provides a starting point for building an extensible and well-structured in-memory database.
As you develop the project, consider adding features and optimizations that would make your database more powerful and efficient.
Make sure to document your code and design decisions to facilitate contributions from the open-source community.

Good luck with your project!
